Hello everyone! 

This is a simple program that I've created to localize your birthday if you live in a different country of your birth origin. 

I have not included a lot of checks of input, so I ask you to please follow all the guidlines that are printed, otherwise it won't work properly.

Used modules: 
datetime
pytz
tzlocal

datetime is a native python module, whereas pytz and tzlocal you would need to install via pip install.

pytz:
pip install pytz 

tzlocal:
pip install tzlocal 

This was a fun challenge and I'm happy with the result. This took a lot of time to build from scratch as I'm still improving so any feedback would be appreciated! 

Thanks and hope you enjoy this simple project.
